/**
 * Class encoding a JWT token payload of the type used by PHDP. For documentation of the format,

 * repository.

 * Note that this class does NOT perform the various checks required by the APIs. It does not
 * require any fields to be present in the JSON to be parsed, either (though it will always
 * fill in the "iss" claim in instances since it has a fixed value).
